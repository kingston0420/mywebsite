    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p> I am a fourth-year electrical engineering student at the University of British Columbia. 
        As an international student who has been to more than ten countries, I value the diversity around me. 
        I love knowing new people because I believe that everyone is unique in their own way and there is always something new to learn from every individual as we all come from different places, have different backgrounds, and tell different stories. 
        I enjoy working in a team and learn from each other along the way of accomplishing our project. 
        I always open my mind to learn new things and never give up on things I love because I believe that "failure is simply the opportunity to begin again."
