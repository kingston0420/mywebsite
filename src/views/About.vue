    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p> <span style="font-size: 2em;">I</span> am a third-year electrical engineering student at the University of British Columbia. 
        As an international student who has been to more than ten countries, I value the diversity around me. 
        I love knowing new people because I believe that everyone is unique in their own way and there is always something new to learn from every individual. 
        I enjoy working in a team and learning from each other along the way of accomplishing our project. 
        In this innovative world, I always open my mind to learn and never give up on things I love because I believe that "failure is simply the opportunity to begin again."
    </p>

    <p> <br><span style="font-size: 2em;">I</span> enjoy coding and making project in my free time. The best feeling is seeing my work help solve real world problems and being used by people around the world.
        I also love dancing because it allows me to connect with people with different culture and background while learning and communicating through dance.
        Finally, I love playing volleybal, soccer, and basketball. These exercises clears up my head and gives me the energy to work on more projects in the next day.
