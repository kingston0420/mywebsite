    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p> <span style="font-size: 2em;">I</span> am a third-year electrical engineering student at the University of British Columbia. 
    As an international student who has been to more than ten countries, I value the diversity around me. 
    I love getting to know new people, because I believe that everyone is unique in their own way and there is always something new to learn from every individual. 
    I enjoy working in a team and learning from each other along the way of accomplishing a project together. 
    In this innovative world, I always open my mind to learn and never give up on things I love because I believe that "failure is simply the opportunity to begin again."
    </p>

    <p> <br><span style="font-size: 2em;">I</span> enjoy coding and making projects in my free time. 
    The best feeling is seeing my work help solve real world problems and for my work to be used by people around the world. 
    I also love dancing in my free time, because it allows me to connect with people with different cultures and backgrounds in the process of learning and communicating together on the stage or in the studio. 
    Finally, I love playing volleyball, soccer, and basketball. These exercises clear my mind and give me the energy to work on more projects the next day.
